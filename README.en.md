## Installation

Download the compressed package from the [Releases](https://github.com/ww-rm/SpineViewer/releases) page.

The program requires the [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) to be installed.

You can also download packages with the `SelfContained` suffix, which can run independently without additional installations.

Exporting GIF/MP4 or other animated/video formats requires **ffmpeg** installed locally and added to the system PATH. Download [FFmpeg for Windows](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) or the latest full build [ffmpeg-release-full.7z](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z).

## Changing Display Language

Currently, the program supports the following interface languages:

- `ZH` (Chinese)
- `EN` (English)
- `JA` (Japanese)

Change the language via the menu: **File → Preferences… → Language**, then confirm.

---

## Usage

### Overview

The program uses a left-right layout: the left panel contains controls, the right panel displays the preview.

The left panel contains three sub-panels:

- **Models**: Lists imported and rendered models. Set model parameters, rendering order, and other model-related functions here.
- **Browser**: Preview files in a folder without actually importing them. Generate WebP previews or import selected models.
- **Canvas**: Set parameters for the right-side preview display.

Most buttons, labels, or input fields show help text on hover.

---

### Importing Skeletons

Drag-and-drop or paste skeleton files/folders directly into the **Models** panel.

Alternatively, use the right-click menu in the **Browser** panel to import selected items.

---

### Adjusting Content

The **Models** panel supports right-click menus, some hotkeys, and batch editing via multi-selection.

Mouse interactions in the preview panel:

- **Left click**: select and drag models. Hold `Ctrl` for multi-selection (synchronized with the model list).
- **Right click**: drag the entire canvas.
- **Mouse wheel**: zoom in/out. Hold `Ctrl` to scale selected models together.
- **Render selected only**: preview only the selected models, selection can only be changed via the left panel.

Playback controls below the preview allow time adjustment, acting as a simple player.

---

### Exporting Content

Right-click on models in the list to access export options.

Key export parameters:

- **Output folder**: Optional. If not provided, outputs go to each model’s folder. Otherwise, all outputs go to the specified folder.
- **Single export**: Default exports each model separately. If enabled, all selected models are rendered together in one output.
- **Auto resolution**: Ignores preview canvas resolution; exported resolution matches the actual size of content. For animations or videos, ensures full display of the animation.

---

### Dynamic Wallpaper

The dynamic wallpaper projects the current preview content to the desktop in real time.

Enable or disable via program preferences or the tray icon menu. Save workspace files to preserve model and canvas settings.

Auto-start with Windows can also be enabled, along with loading a specific workspace on startup.

---

### Command-line Tool

The project includes a CLI tool `SpineViewerCLI` for simple operations on a single model (querying parameters, exporting, etc.). Windows and Linux binaries are provided in Releases.

```bash
$ SpineViewerCLI -h
